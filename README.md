# windows_timer
a 2 hours timer (for now) creates a window that stays on top
more features to add 
- button to START / PAUSE the timer (URGENT)
- Customisable timer not always 2 hours (NON IMPORTANT)
- sounds when finishes or get to a point (NON IMPORTANT)
- background change (NON IMPORTANT)

- what did i learn :
- how windows creates window , how to communicate with the window using messages , Unicode strings , understand windows prototypes , break free from old c++98.
